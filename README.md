# Virtual Society Simulation

## What is it?

Virtual Society is an aid in order to test software using life-like simulations. Primarily Virtual Society is being developed 
for designers within software engineering and data science. Virtual Society offers simulations within a chain of automated
systems, through providing these systems with life events. These events are modelled within the simulation and executes these.
Examples of these life events are births and deaths, leaving the parental home, starting a family, etc.
It is crucial to note that this information is completely fabricated: it is synthetic data generated by the simulation.

Since Virtual Society generates data through its simulations, data cannot be traced back to real personal information.
The upside of using synthetic data is that the privacy of citizens is not affected. On top of this, synthetic data is much
more accessible for a broader audience.
Simulations are a replication (digital twin) of reality. Simulation is a dynamic and complex process. Through Virtual Society
we achieve the aforementioned based on life events. This simulation model determines through the use of rules derived from
algorithms how the simulation progresses.

## Roadmap

The first milestone will simulate enough parameters to Simulate a synthetic population for the social domain. (BRP, basis registratie personen) such as:
    * Partner History
    * Family Situation (Sibblings / Ages)
    * Migrations

## Components

The following open source components are used for simulations

### Sim# (SimSharp) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/hyn83qegeiga81o2/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/abeham/simsharp/branch/master)
A .NET port and extension of SimPy, process-based discrete event simulation framework
<br/>

https://github.com/abeham/SimSharp
### Stateless [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/dotnet-state-machine/stateless?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DotnetStateMachine/stateless/branch/master) [![NuGet Pre Release](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Stateless.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/stateless) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/dotnet-state-machine/stateless](https://badges.gitter.im/dotnet-state-machine/stateless.svg)](https://gitter.im/dotnet-state-machine/stateless?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Stack Overflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/stackoverflow-tag-orange.svg)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/stateless-state-machine)

Create *state machines* and lightweight *state machine-based workflows* directly in .NET code:
<br/>
https://github.com/dotnet-state-machine/stateless/blob/dev/README.md


Stateless is mainly used for state integrity of simulated objects.

```csharp
public PersonState(LifeEvents initialState) : base(initialState)
{
    Machine.Configure(LifeEvents.Born)
        .Permit(LifeEventsTriggers.Die, LifeEvents.Deceased)
        .Permit(LifeEventsTriggers.Adulthood, LifeEvents.Adult);
    Machine.Configure(LifeEvents.Adult)
        .Permit(LifeEventsTriggers.Die, LifeEvents.Deceased)
        .Permit(LifeEventsTriggers.Mary, LifeEvents.Married);
    Machine.Configure(LifeEvents.Married)
        .Permit(LifeEventsTriggers.Die, LifeEvents.Deceased)
        .Permit(LifeEventsTriggers.Divorce, LifeEvents.Divorced);
    Machine.Configure(LifeEvents.Divorced)
        .Permit(LifeEventsTriggers.Die, LifeEvents.Deceased)
        .Permit(LifeEventsTriggers.Mary, LifeEvents.Married);
    Machine.Activate();
}
```

Stateless is extended so the states and triggers / flow can be easily visualized in Force Directed Graphs using force graph.
